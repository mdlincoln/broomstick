# broomstick

[![Travis-CI Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/mdlincoln/broomstick.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/mdlincoln/broomstick)

The goal of broomstick is to extend the [`broom`](https://github.com/tidyverse/broom) package to work with decision trees. It is currently borrowing heavily from the prototype package [`treezy`](https://github.com/njtierney/treezy), and will undergo much more development in the coming months.

## Installation

You can install broomstick from github with:

```{r gh-installation, eval = FALSE}
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("njtierney/broomstick")
```

## Example

```{r example-rpart}
library(rpart)
library(broomstick)

fit_rpart <- rpart(Kyphosis ~ Age + Number + Start, 
                   data = kyphosis)

tidy(fit_rpart)
```
